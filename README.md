###This is a project that I created to reviewed SSH frameworks intergration.Not deepin in it.

* I used spring 3.2.2 for managing bean.
* Using struts 2.3.4 for control the request.Just we call it action or spring's words controller.
* Using hibernate to do the ORM.
* Maven is a great tools to manage the jar and other resources.But we ommit it at this moment.We'll consider it in the future.


Frameworks for developing is a great thing.But heavily depends on the frameworks will make us not knowing what to do without it.
So friends,if you want to step forward in software career,go to the basic first.Then the frameworks.
